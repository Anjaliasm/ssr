One of the biggest\nand most well-liked programming competition platforms in the\nworld, CodeChef is favored by both amateur and expert\nprogrammers. College Chapters are programming groups with a focus\non competition and are supervised and mentored by CodeChef. With\nthe help of the CodeChef platform, College Chapters are able to\nshare knowledge among themselves and foster a strong culture of\ncompetitive programming throughout all Indian institutions and\nschools. 2B. The cyber security club of the Universal College of\nEngineering is called Ncrypted. The group's main objective is to\nprovide technical tools to students interested in cybersecurity\nso they can advance their careers in the industry. The club\nachieves this by hosting alternate-weekly meetings where\nparticipants may talk about and put into practice practical\ncybersecurity concepts like network security, digital forensics,\npenetration testing, secure coding, cryptography, and reverse\nengineering. The club's competition team meets once in a month to\ntake part in cyber security exercises. These training sessions\ngive the squad the chance to compete against other institutions\nfrom across the world while applying offensive and defensive\ncybersecurity techniques.\n3. Enhancement in Online events The IQAC initiative has led to\nsignificant enhancements in online events organized by students.\nThese improvements have enriched the virtual experiences and\nengagement of participants. Firstly, students have incorporated\nadvanced virtual platforms, making events more accessible and\ninteractive. They have also diversified the event formats,\nincorporating webinars, virtual conferences, and hackathons,\ncatering to a broader audience. The inclusion of prominent guest\nspeakers and industry experts has brought valuable insights to\nthe events. Additionally, engineering students have utilized\ninnovative tools for networking, encouraging meaningful\nconnections among attendees. The initiative has also focused on\nimproving event promotion through social media campaigns and\ntargeted outreach, resulting in higher attendance rates. Overall,\nthese efforts have elevated the quality of online events,\nproviding a valuable platform for knowledge sharing, skill\ndevelopment, and networking opportunities for all participants\ninvolved. 3A.

Participants will explore\nkey concepts, hands-on exercises, and real-world examples to gain\npractical knowledge in developing dynamic and interactive web\napplications using ReactJS.\n4. Introduction of Add-on Courses As an initiative by IQAC,\nUniversal College of Engineering had organized an Add On Course \u201c\nMathematical Modelling\u201d for all the software branches of Second\nyear Students. The course duration was 24 hours in which the\nMathematics sessions were 12 hours and practical sessions were 12\nhours. The course was designed to help the students grasp the\nfundamentals of probability, measures of dispersion, correlation\nand regression, and linear algebra. After completing the course,\nthe students were able to use the theory of statistics and\ncomprehend how linear algebra may be used to solve engineering\nchallenges in data science, machine learning, and artificial\nintelligence. Using assignments, transportation, and traveling\nsalesman procedures, the students may also apply the idea of\nvarious regression models for calculating data and comprehend a\nrange of real-life probability circumstances.\n5. Awareness to students about Social services Under the IQAC\n(Internal Quality Assurance Cell) initiative, the students under\nNSS & Rotaract Club of the Institute have actively engaged in\nvarious commendable social services. These services aim to\npositively impact their communities and foster meaningful change.\nStudents have taken up initiatives such as organizing Camp at\nNagle village for underprivileged children, promoting digital\nliteracy by conducting computer training sessions, and providing\nskill development programs to empower marginalized individuals.\nAdditionally, students participated in environmental conservation\nactivities, including tree planting drives and awareness\ncampaigns on sustainable practices. Moreover, they have extended\ntheir support to nearby schools by renovating infrastructure,\nsetting up libraries, and donating essential learning materials.\nThe Clubs also initiated an idea of Book Donation drive to\nunderprivileged students. To support the local tribal people, the\nstudents marketed the hand-made Rakhis (sacred thread tied by\nsister to her brother) from them and the collected revenue was\ngiven back as a token of well being.Through these diverse\nendeavors, the students have demonstrated their commitment to\nsocial responsibility and contributed to creating a more\ninclusive and sustainable society.\n12.Plan of action chalked out by the IQAC in the beginning of the Academic year towards\nPage 18/136 01-09-2023 09:45:34",

Keeping this in mind, as a part\nof Unnat Bharat Abhiyan in association with Innovation cell and NSS group,\nUniversal College of Engineering, organised a workshop to train students and\nsensitize them towards solar energy in the college premises on 2nd October 2019,\nmarking the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, who epitomized the cause\nof nonviolence (principles). Wherein more than 200 students from various\ndepartments assembled their own solar study lamps and also took a pledge of\nNonviolence towards the Environment.\n3. Energy Transformania: The event is based on the concept of Contraption. This\nis a chain reaction between mechanical linkages that form various mechanisms. The\nwhole mechanism is structured using waste material from households or Industry.\nThe energy input given in the first stage completes the final target via several\nenergy conversions throughout the process. The project has helped students to\ncombine their creativity with fundamentals of Physics and Mechanics to create a\nMechanical System. A part of this team is then selected for participation in a\ntechnical event called Goldberg\u2019s Alley held every year at IIT(BHU), Varanasi and\nbagged 1st runnerup prize.\n4. Project Based Learning: Project based learning is the skill development\nprogram for students where students can implement their subject knowledge with\npractical implementation. This was the platform offered to SE and TE students to\nexplore their knowledge by implementing one project in semester apart from their\ncurriculum projects. Students were able to understand the development of problem\nstatement solutions, design User interface for Product. \u201cProject Exhibition of\nBest Projects in PBL\u201d was organized on 18th October 2020. All faculties from UCoE\nvisited every project in the exhibition and gave their feedback on work done.\n5. Inauguration of Rotaract Club: Rotaract Club of Universal College of\nEngineering was initiated in the year 2019. This club was established under the\nguidance of Rotary Club of Vasai. Clubs main motive was to bring the hidden\ntalent out from their members. To make every Rotaractor dream come true be it big\nor small was the initial thought behind initializing the club. Each member is\nlearning new things on a daily basis. Members have developed professionally as\nwell as personally. Members who were timid and not so confident are leading the\nteam and have overcome their shyness. Every member comes up with an innovative\nidea which is helpful for every club member. Teamwork is the key for the growth\nof this club. It has been two years to this club and together every member so far\nhas achieved a lot. Expanding the team as much as they can is the aim of this\nclub. Clubs main focus is that all their members should get professional world\nexposure. Future plan is to take the minor scale projects to the major scale.\nMore precisely, the club is focused on Community Service projects.\nView File\n13.

(maximum 500 words)\nUniversal College of Engineering adopts a confidential mentoring system wherein the students are asked for\ntheir technical/personal problems, suggestions, and necessary actions taken on that basis. The procedure of\nmentoring starts from the first year of engineering till the end of the program. First year\u2019s(FE) students have\nmentors from the Applied Science and Humanities department. The FE students are furnished with mentoring\nform, which asks for their basic details and family background. Mentors are assigned to students as per the ratio\ngiven by AICTE. Apart from this, details like co-curricular and extra-curricular activities are also maintained.\nFaculty(mentor) and students(mentee) meet at regular intervals and discuss the problems faced by the students\nin concern with the academics, personal,extra-curricular or anything related to overall development of the\nstudent. All the information is kept strictly confidential with the mentors to encourage the students to be open and\nfearless. Second, third- and fourth-year students are assigned mentors from the parent department and each\ndepartment independently takes care of their students. Before the clearance of the faculty profile from the\nInstitute, he/she has to introduce the mentees to the new mentor. The Institution also keeps a track record of the\nstudents one year post the completion of BE regarding the student\u2019s higher studies and placements. Apart from\nthe mentoring system employed in the Institution, a counseling center has also been set up in the Institution from\nthe Academic year 2018-2019 which is headed by Dr. J. B.

Based on the\nfeedback and conclusions drawn from the previous semester results, continuous\nimprovements in the internal evaluation are introduced. Classroom lectures were\nreoriented to discuss the possible questions and the proper way of representing\nand answering the questions. Due to unforeseen Covid 19 circumstances in the\ncurrent academic year, a shifting paradigm was experienced in the teaching and\nlearning methodology with the need for online education. Adapting quickly to\nthe situation, we started extensively adopting online LMS Systems such as\nGoogle Classroom, Google Meet, YouTube Live and then moved on to using various\nplugins and extensions to make the overall teaching experience smooth. To make\nlectures interactive, we started making use of online tools such as Prezi,\nEdpuzzle, Hot Potatoes, and animated explainers. It has now been a part of our\nteaching and learning methodology and a notion of blended learning has been\ninculcated in the process which is going to stay for a long time. The\nevaluation of term work, as prescribed by University of Mumbai, contains\nassignments, case studies, mini-project, attendance, and performance in the\nlaboratory. For the Internal Assessment Test, papers are set keeping in mind\nthe learning objectives and the understanding of the fundamental concept of the\nCourse. The presentations of the case study, which are beyond the prescribed\nsyllabus, are also conducted and marks are awarded as per the performance. All\nthese evaluations are considered in the students\u2019 marksheet.\n2.5.3 \u2013 Academic calendar prepared and adhered for conduct of Examination and other related matters (250\nwords)\nUniversal College of Engineering, an institute affiliated with the University\nof Mumbai(UoM) prepares its academic calendar in adherence to the calendar of\nUoM. All the Head of the Departments, Event/activity coordinators submit their\nline of action for Inter-departmental activities. The academic calendar is\nprepared at the institute level articulating all the above points wherein the\nfirst six weeks are allocated to conduct lectures and practicals followed by\nthe first Internal Assessment test. The 2nd Internal assessment test is\nconducted in the fourteenth week. The fifteenth week is considered the term-end",

All the extracurricular activities and\nevents to be held in an Academic year are planned according to the UoM\ncalendar. Due to the pandemic situation this year, all the tests and End\nsemester examinations were conducted in online mode. Our teachers and the\nexamination committee members made sure that no malpractice happens during the\nonline examination by ensuring strict proctoring using webcams and recorded\ngoogle meet sessions. Tests were conducted using google forms and shared with\nthe students using the google meet chat box only during the examination time\nalong with 15min extra for scanning uploading the answer book.

        "text": "students to keep themselves updated with the latest art of technology. To help\nstudents to cater to the needs and demands of the corporate world and make them\nindependent thinkers and bridge the gap between theoretical and practical\nneeds. To make the students learn things on their own with the guidance of the\nexperts. Context: UCOE emphasizes practical skills in students by taking\nadvantage of campus infrastructure, laboratories and workshops. College always\nencourages students to get hands-on experience through participating in\ntechnical challenges, specially designed for domain specific applications. This\nactivity facilitates college to make the transition from academic to\nprofessional environments. It has also helped students to develop their\nconfidence and meet the challenges of life. UCOE has always helped students to\nbe good at communications by introducing special events which will help them to\ninteract confidently and develop a desirable personality for their future.\nPractice: Student Council of UCoE in support of faculty members organizes an\nintra-college technical fest for the aspirants assembling from various\nengineering branches with a very high competitive spirit to participate and\nwith the strong determination to include their achievements and accomplishments\nto their resumes. Tantrotsav aims to bring together opportunities for students\nto come forward and showcase their talents and maximise their visions in the\npracticality of education, which is very important in today\u2019s dialect of the\nengineering community. Students actively participated in all the events and\npresented their work. The fest executed with a total of 16 events planned and\norganized at its best of quality. Events for Civil engineering students are\ncorrelated to exposure to concrete technology and also to finding effective\nsolutions or ideas for disaster risk management in a series of hypothetical\nnatural calamity situations. Theme of the event under electronic and\ntelecommunication engineering is based on Robotics and Automation in home,\nindustry and agriculture usage. Computer Engineering and Information Technology\nbased events like AIHack ( Artificial Intelligence solution for smart systems\n), coding challenges and Web mania. Winners of these events were appreciated\nwith certificates and awards, also they were encouraged to represent college at\nintercollegiate events. Evidence of Success: Winners at this event has\nparticipated and won competitions at various IITs Winners at Smart India\nHackathon Participation in various project exhibition and award function Some\nStudent Designed Mobile Apps have been commercialised and are available on play\nstore e.g. QuickScanner,UCoE App Best Practice 2 Title of the Practice: e-\nNewsletter Objective of the Practice To connect and nurture all Institute\nstakeholders by building and providing the kind of valuable, insightful content\non a regular basis. To provide updates pertaining to departmental events,\nworkshops, certification, faculty/students achievements, technical trends,\nproducts, services, etc To update and encourage the students to keep themselves\nupdated with the latest art of technology in the industry. To provide the\nstudents a platform through which they get to learn how to create useful\nreports, articles, digital content by exploring various possibilities of\ndesign, graphics, literature etc. The Context Publishing a regular newsletter\nis an essential aspect of any communications strategy. UCoE publishes a\nnewsletter regularly through electronic medium for every course. Through the\nnewsletter, the college tries to bring the world news at the doorstep of the\nstudents. The Newsletter posted electronically (e-Newsletters) has ease of\naccessibility among the students which has called for its huge success. This\nknowledge goes beyond the course, knowledge where the total well being of the\nstudents is enriched and kept in the mind. Practice: Every department of UCoE\npublishes their e-Newsletters monthly since 2018. All the newsletters get\nuploaded These electronic letter copies are also digitally distributed\npersonally to all staff and students on college websites. These e-newsletters\nhave gained rapid acceptance and popularity over printed correspondence.\nGeneral attributes of the newsletter include news and upcoming events of the\norganization, as well as publication of research articles and recent trends in",

Difficulty in consistent data collection. Time consuming in\nidentification of originality, genuinity or source identification needs lots of\nbackground work. Best Practice 3 Title of the practice: Preparation for\nCompetitive Learning Objective of the practice: Encourage the students to\nparticipate in the technical competitions across India. To help students to\ncater to the skills and implement them in real life problems. To make the\nstudents learn through hands-on sessions and practice. To push the students to\ninnovate ideas by sponsoring their in competition-project work. Showcase the\nprojects to the potential incubator. Encourage Innovations, Patents startups.\nTo provide students a platform to practice their skills required for exploring\nnew technologies. . Context: UCOE has always been proactive in organizing and\nparticipating in various technical competitions at the Inter-collegiate and\nIntra-collegiate level. Keeping the same view in mind, an innovative idea has\nemerged and is being implemented since the last three years, where students are\nprepared towards various technical competitions across IITs. Through these\ntargeted events students are given an opportunity to participate in a prototype\nenvironment of real Competitions that are to be held across India every year.\nStudents are made to prepare for competitions outside UCoE through specially\ndesigned college events like \u2018Energy Transformania\u2019, Tantrotsav and \u2018HACK-\nSTOMP\u2019. Practice The coding competition of UCoE is Hackstomp\u2019. It is based on\nthe idea of SIH (Smart India Hackathon) organized by the Ministry of Human\nResource, Government of India- The challenge is to solve a real life problem.\nThis internal hackathon is a 24hrs non-stop coding competition for engineering\nstudents all over Mumbai. This years theme of the event was \u201cInnovation for\nIndia\u201d. This event helps students in identifying problems, preparing solutions,\nintegrating judges suggestions and participating in intercollegiate coding\nchallenges with more zeal and vigor. The shortlisted teams were encouraged to\nparticipate in the Grand Finale of SIH-2020. Another most liked event is based\non the concept of Contraption (Energy transfer through a series of mechanisms)\nnamed Energy Transformania\u2019. This is a chain reaction between mechanical\nlinkages that form various mechanisms. The energy input given in the first\nstage completes the final target via several energy conversions throughout the\nprocess. UCoE undertook this project from the academic year 2018-19. It was\nshowcased during the annual technical festival- VYRO. A part of this team is\nthen selected for participation in a technical event every year at IIT,\nVaranasi. Since the last two years this team has been performing and winning in\nIIT events. A budget was approved by the college for the same idea.. All the\nevents can be considered as the prototypes of mega events that are held at\nvarious IITs every year. This enables a mock round for all the interested\nstudents and tests their skills. Evidence of Success: Student team selected as\nnational Finals of the e-Yantra Ideas Competition (eYIC 2019-20) at IIT Bombay\nfor Seventh e-Yantra Symposium (eYS 2020) A Energy Transformania sub-team has\nsecured 1 st runner-up rank in Goldberg\u2019s Alley at IIT Varanasi during\nTechnex\u201920 in February 2020.

In this process, the syllabus represents the scheme of end semester marks\nalong with the term test marks, term work, assignment, tutorial, oral and\npractical examination marks applicable to the concerned Course of the Program.\nBased on result analysis of the previous semester, continuous improvements in\nthe mode of internal evaluation are suggested by the Head of Department and\nPrincipal. Classroom lectures were reoriented to discuss the possible End\nSemester Examination questions and the proper expected way of representing and\nanswering the questions. After careful deliberations and discussions with the\ncore members of the department, some new ideas have been introduced. These\ninclude conducting mock viva as a part of continuous assessment and\nunderstanding the exact reasons for lack of satisfactory student academic\nperformances. Tutorials are dedicated to solving numerical problems (from\nprevious University question papers) and also helping slow learners to get more\nattention. The evaluation of term work contains assignments, case studies, mini-\nproject, attendance, and performance in the laboratory, as suggested in\nrespective courses by the University of Mumbai. Students are apprised about the\nEducational Objectives and course outcomes expected from them during the very\nfirst lecture of the course. Our institute conducts two Internal Assessment\nTests each of 20 or 15 marks as per the test scheme prescribed in the syllabus\nof respective courses. The average of the two test marks are evaluated and\ndisplayed for the reference of the students so that each student can gauge the\nself-performance level. This average of term test marks is considered in the\noverall grade in the Semester End Examination. For the Internal Assessment\nTest, papers are set keeping in mind the learning objectives and the\nunderstanding of the fundamental concept of the Course. Course Outcome versus\nProgram Outcome attainment values are worked out to evaluate the need for\nfurther improvements. The Course Exit Survey forms are an indicator of the\nsuccess of the reforms introduced and implemented and further reforms if\nrequired are implemented. The presentations of the case study, which are beyond\nthe prescribed syllabus, are also conducted and marks are awarded as per the\nperformance. Project dissertation marks are awarded only for final year\nstudents. The final presentation with the actual model of the project is\nevaluated by an internal expert and industry experienced person. All these\nmarks are considered in the final University examination.

Students staff are motivated to use Public Transport for weekly commutes. As\nthe college location is away from metropolitan, it was decided to increase the\nquantum of public transport from certain locations to the campus. The students\nand staff members were motivated to use public transport. A dedicated personnel\nwas appointed to take care of issuance of student concession passess applicable\nto the state transportation and railways. The details are maintained regularly.\nBuses facilities are in place from Borivali, Vasai, Thane Bhayandar to the\ncollege, where a considerable number of students take up this facility\nwillingly on a yearly basis. A total of 428 students have opted for these\nservices this year. College timings are aligned with the frequencies of state\ntransport and railways that run till nearby locations.\n2. Initiatives are being taken to implement technological aspects in the domain\nof Environment Consciousnesses. An innovative project was undertaken to\nredesign an automobile to convert it into a solar powered vehicle. A team of\nstudents guided and mentored by teaching and non teaching staff has worked on\nthe project rigorously to make this eco-friendly project a success. The\nsuccessful project symbolizes the green reforms that the institute is\nconstantly proposing and does motivate the students to take part in parallel\ninitiatives. The project was funded by the college. The vehicle is regularly\nmaintained for its service parameters and is run for demonstrations and study\npurposes during technical events as well as exhibitions. Aspiring students are\nmotivated to study the design of this vehicle and bring about suitable changes\nin line with the advancements in the technologies. Ahead of this, few other\nprojects are also proposed in the same domain. Such projects are exhibited in\nthe entrance to spread awareness among visitors and other stakeholders about\nthese small steps taken towards Environment Consciousness.\n3. Water well present in the campus is regularly cleaned and the water\nreservoir is maintained for clean water. Every year the cleanliness activities\nfor the well is arranged with the help of a third party service. Generally the\ndrive lasts for a couple of days. The care is taken that this source of water\nis kept in use and the sediments, if any, are removed to avoid congestion of\nthis water body. Another available water resource is borewell. This is the main\nsource of water that is pumped for various utilities. The same is also well\nmaintained. A rainwater harvesting system is initiated for recharging these\nresources.\n4. Green Infrastructure: The building of college is planned constructed in such\na way that ample amount of sunlight and wind will flow-in to save the\nelectricity. This has resulted in reduction in excess usage of electricity.\nApart from this the building walls are painted uniformly in white. This helps\nin illuminating the classrooms and laboratories for the majority period in a\nday. The security officials present on every floor take care that no wastage of\nelectricity takes place in classrooms, laboratories and corridors in absence of\nstudents and staff. These electricity monitoring avoids excess consumption and\nunwanted heat generation is avoided hence ensures that the cooling effect is\nmaintained. This has definitely helped reduce carbon footprint in a passive\nmanner.",

The light has been in service\nof the semi-highway guiding the commuters especially in the nights and foggy\ntimes. The project was funded by the college.\n6. Various other steps have been taken to make the entire campus clean and\ngreen and provide an eco-friendly environment in Universal College of\nEngineering. Some of them are: 1. Environmental awareness amongst students is\ninculcated through various awareness events and tree plantation programs within\nthe campus. The campus is maintained for greenery and this is maintained by\nproper curator services. 2. Organic Farming is such an initiative that has\nattracted considerable student strength. The team is working really well and\nhas planned certain activities which can boost Agricultural practices with the\nhelp of Technology. Recently, an inhouse compost pit was installed as a\nconcurrent activity for organic farming, on trial basis. 3. Waste management is\nstarted by means of its segregation in Dry and Wet waste. Specific bins are\ninstalled at prominent places in the campus for the same. Wet waste is used as\na fuel for Compost Pit. 4. Organization of expert talks on aligned issues to\ncreate awareness among students and staff. A talk on \u2018waste water recycling\u2019\nwas organised for the students of first year, creating awareness among\nstudents. 5. Reuse of stationary like used papers from one side are being used\nwherever possible. This saves a considerable amount of papers, contributing to\nthe greening initiatives indirectly.\n7.2 \u2013 Best Practices\n7.2.1 \u2013 Describe at least two institutional best practices\nBest Practice 1 Title of the Practice: Internship and Pre-placement Training.\nObjective of the Practice: 1. To get students trained with the latest technical\ndevelopments in the industry 2. To get the necessary skills required for their\nemployment, innovation ability and research orientation. 3. To provide\nemployment opportunities. 4. To get industry exposure in the overall career\ndevelopment of the student. 5. To encourage students for internships and value-\nadded training programs. 6. Providing a cutting edge over other college\nstudents during the pool campus recruitment drive. 7. Provide a platform to\nexplore work culture and opportunities in various allied domains like\nCleanliness The Context: Placement is one of the most important factors that\nstudents expect while pursuing a course. Pre-Placement Training not only\ndirects students to pick the right career but also encourages them to perform\nwell during the hiring process.Universal College of Engineering (UCoE) in\nassociation with expert aptitude trainers from \u2018CoCube\u2019, has taken this\ninitiative. UCoE has collaborated with a third party agency that uses\ntechnology to help corporate in assessing and hiring candidates from campus and\nbeyond Institute. This initiative has helped the Institute measure and improve\nemployability. This is to ensure that every student in any corner of UCoE gets\nan equal opportunity to build a career. Aptitude test series has been designed\non logical, quantitative and reasoning Skills which is the first step of\nplacement training. In addition to the domain knowledge of the Engineering\nprofession, other skills and abilities such as communication skills,\nleadership, innovation, team building are required to become successful in the\ncareer, which are not directly covered in the curriculum.These series of tests\nand workshops helps students to recognize their talent and shortcomings.

The procedure of mentoring is\nstarts from first year of engineering till the end of the program. First years students have mentors from Applied\nScience and Humanities department. The FE students are furnished with mentoring form, which asks for their\nbasic details and family background. Mentors areas assigned to students as per ratio given by AICTE. Every\nstudent has to spend at least an hour a week with their mentors and the mentors discuss about their attendance\nrecord, academic performance, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. All the information is kept strictly\nconfidential with the mentors to encourage the students to be open and fearless. Second, third, fourth year\nstudents assigned mentors from the parent department and each department independently takes care of their\nstudents. If a faculty has left the institution, immediately, a new faculty is assigned and the new mentor is made\naware of the mentee by the leaving faculty. At regular intervals, faculty(Mentor) and students(Mentee) meet and\ndiscussed problems faced by the students pertaining to the Institution, academics, personal, etc. and necessary\naction is taken with concerned department. The Institution also keeps a track record of the students one year\npost the completion of BE regarding the student\u2019s higher studies and placements. Apart from the mentoring\nsystem employed in the Institution, a counselling centre is also working in the Institution from the Academic year\n2018-2019 which is headed by Mr Joel Phillip (Asst Prof from the department of IT) and Dr J.

To improve the\nsituation, various solutions were considered based on the students\u2019 feedback\nreceived by the mentors and different suggestions by IQAC. Classroom lectures\nwere reoriented to discuss the possible questions and the proper way of\nrepresenting and answering the questions. After careful deliberations and\ndiscussions with the core members of the department, some new ideas have been\nintroduced. These include conducting viva as a part of continuous assessment\nand understanding the exact reasons for lack of satisfactory performances.\nTutorials are dedicated to solving numerical problems and also helping slow\nlearners to get more attention.

The average of the two tests marks, are evaluated and displayed for the reference of the\nstudents, so that each student can gauge self-performance level. This average of term tests marks\nare considered in the theory marks of Semester End Examination.\nFor the Internal Assessment Test, papers are set keeping in mind the learning objectives and the\nunderstanding of the fundamental concept of the Course. Course Outcome, attainment values are\nworked out to evaluate the need for further improvements. Students are apprised about the\nEducational Objectives and the end of course outcomes, expected from them. The Course Exit\nSurvey forms are an indicator of the success of the reforms introduced and implemented and further\nreforms if required are implemented.\nThe presentations of case study, which are beyond the prescribed syllabus, are also conducted and\nmarks are awarded as per the performance. Project marks are awarded only for final year students.\nThe final presentation with actual model of project is evaluated by internal expert and industry\nexperienced person. All these marks are considered in the Final University Examination. These\nrules are subject to change as per the instructions by the university.\nPage 31/88 25-09-2018 12:34:59",

The details of academic calendar are followed in planning and execution of the same. Under the\ninternal assessment, two tests are held for each subject in all the semester\u2019s and additional tests are\nconducted for absentees due to medical reasons and/or sports personnel representing the institute at various\nlevels on the scheduled dates of test. Marks obtained are regularized based on the university rules for the\nsame. The question papers are based on similar lines as the original test paper, to be fair in marking these\nstudents. Test marks are recorded using Applane software.\nFor assessment, each faculty has to prepare a model answer for respective question paper. To ensure\ntransparency, the marks are displayed on the notice board and the students are given the opportunity to\nglance through their assessed answer sheets and convince themselves that the marking has been fair and\nclear. Any discrepancies brought to the notice of the faculty members, are either clarified or immediate\nremedial measures are taken to rectify the same.\n2.5.3 Mechanism to deal with examination related grievances is transparent, time-bound and\nefficient\nResponse:\nVery few students have exam related grievances and a proper mechanism has been set up to deal with any\npossible cases. In case a student has any doubts about his assessment, he is free to ask for a copy of the\nanswer sheet. If in his/her opinion, there are some discrepancies, he is required to make a written\napplication requesting revaluation and paying the requisite fees as applicable. The paper is then sent to a\nsenior faculty for revaluation. This faculty is invariably from a different college than that of the Moderator\nwho had visited for the subject. This ensures unbiased revaluation. In majority of the cases the grievance is\nresolved within seven working days. Revaluation marks are displayed on the notice board.\nThe entire process is handled by the Examination cell and all records are maintained with them to have a\ncentralized control. Any relevant data required for any departmental work can be obtained from the\nExamination cell. Hitherto there have been no pending cases for more than the stipulated ten working\ndays. Presently the system is found to be robust, efficient and without inordinate delays.\nIf any malpractice case is detected and brought to the attention of the exam authority, action is taken as\nprescribed in Ordinance 5050.\n2.5.4 The institution adheres to the academic calendar for the conduct of CIE\nResponse:\nPage 32/88 25-09-2018 12:34:59",

Universal College of Engineering (UCoE) practices different teaching-learning methodologies which concentrate on imparting\neducation through a student-centric approach. Apart from the traditional chalk and board method, students are motivated to think\nout of the box and go beyond the book. We have implemented in our lesson plans open classrooms, Short-Term Training\nPrograms, Workshops, FDPs, Webinars, and guest lectures on various streams. Students are motivated to enroll themself in\ndifferent educational platforms like Courseera, ICT academy, Oracle, Cisco, palo alto and get the certificate. Students also join\ncommunity service through NSS and UBA.Student participation in project based learning and NPTEL are encouraged. Students\nare also encouraged to do research on advanced topics and publish the paper in a good conference. The internship is provided\nright from the First Year to equip students with hands-on practical knowledge of the real-life application. An E-cell, a Robotics\nClub, E - Yantra, and virtual lab were established after entering an MOU with IIT Bombay. This helps the students to get an\nunderstanding on a comprehensive level and to think creatively.\nCreativity, scientific and innovative thinking, and analysis are integral parts of problem-solving. UCoE teaching strategies involve\nstudents in the constructive learning environment in the form of guidance textbook method, computer-assisted learning,\nconceptual mapping, case studies, and mini-project.\n3.
